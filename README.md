Adding screenshots to your README file is a great way to showcase your project. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Take Screenshots**: Capture the screenshots of your project. You can use tools like the built-in Snipping Tool on Windows, Screenshot on macOS, or any other screen capture tool.

2. **Save the Screenshots**: Save the screenshots in a directory within your project, for example, `assets/screenshots`.

3. **Add Screenshots to README**: Use Markdown to add the screenshots to your README file. 

Hereâ€™s an example of how to include screenshots in your README:

### Screenshots

1. **Home Page**
   ![Home Page](assets/screenshots/homepage.png)

2. **User Details Page**
   ![User Details Page](assets/screenshots/userdetails.png)

4. **Navigation Sidebar**
   ![Navigation Sidebar](assets/screenshots/sidebar.png)

Make sure the paths to your screenshots are correct. Here's an updated version of your README file with placeholders for screenshots:
